# BlakYak

> An 8-bit Blackjack variant built in Java, with all art designed from scratch.

## About

BlakYak is an Undertale-esque Blackjack game written in Java, featuring original 8-bit pixel art created by me. You start by entering how much money you're bringing to the table, place your bet, and play against an AI dealer, complete with looping background music, funny loss quotes, and a full split hand mechanic.

---

## Features

- Full Blackjack gameplay: Hit, Stand, Split, and Double Down
- AI dealer that follows standard Blackjack soft-17 rules (hits until 17+)
- Split — play two hands simultaneously when your first two cards match
- Double Down — double your bet and take exactly one more card
- Persistent money tracking across rounds; game ends when you go broke
- Full 52-card deck with all four suits (Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts)
- Looping background music (`gameSong.wav`) via Java Sound API
- Original 8-bit pixel art for all cards, the board, and UI elements
- Randomized funny loss quotes on defeat

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- All asset files (`.png` card images, `gameSong.wav`, `Start.png`, `Board.png`, `splitBoard.png`, etc.) must be in the same directory as the compiled classes

### Running the Game

**Option 1 — From your IDE (recommended):**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patela3/BlakYak.git
   ```
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or similar.
3. Run `GameSim.java` to launch a standard game, or `DemoSim.java` to launch with a preset starting hand.

**Option 2 — From the command line:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patela3/BlakYak.git
cd BlakYak/BlakYak/src
javac *.java
java GameSim
```

> Make sure all image and audio assets are present in the working directory before running.

## How to Play

1. **Enter your bankroll** — a dialog asks how much money you're coming in with.
2. **Place your bet** — choose a bet amount (must be at or below your current balance).
3. **You and the dealer are each dealt two cards.** The dealer's first card is face-down.
4. Choose your action:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| Hit | Draw another card from the deck |
| Stand | End your turn; the dealer then plays |
| Split | If your first two cards have equal value, split into two separate hands |
| Double Down | Double your bet and receive exactly one more card |

5. The dealer reveals their hidden card and hits until reaching 17 or higher.
6. Closest to 21 without busting wins. Busting (going over 21) is an automatic loss.

**Card Values:**
- Number cards (2–10): face value
- Jack, Queen, King: 10
- Ace: 11 (automatically counted as 1 if your hand would otherwise bust)
